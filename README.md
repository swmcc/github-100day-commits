## What am I expecting?

I develop for a living am 36 and have outside commitments. So sometimes when I get home
I can't develop or just plain don't feel like it. Burn out is a constant thought on my 
mind during this. That's why I just didn't want to 'break the chain' and I let any commit
or any issue count towards the streak. 

I think that that I've 'cheated' too much and created more issues than I probably should. 
I'll be happy if I've closed more than I've created in this time frame though.

Commits might be a bit light on the ground as time goes on but we will see.

## What do I want to find out?

1. How many issues have I created in the time frame?

2. How manh issues have I closed in the time frame?

3. The longest issue that has been created in this time frame.

4. The shortest issue that has been created in this time frame.

5. How many days did I create just one issue and at what time generally?

6. Number of issues (open/closed) per repo

7. I don't use labels much but any that I do lets do 'something' with them.

8. Lines of code commited in a repo (or something along those lines). Some metric to show the progress of a repo.

9. No. of commits on a day 'v' no. of issues

Present some sort of graphical representation of this data. Probably host it on gh-pages. So more than likely output will be json. 

Write a summary on the gh-pages branch of the findings - add a link to it on this README.

## Development Info
